## This rule set is designed to identify SSI from the clinical notes
Some specificall developed components are used to deal with the metadata, e.g. correct the note date. Thus, this rule set works with SSI especific version of EasyCIE_GUI.
To set it up: copy the directory ssi into the <EasyCIE_GUI root>/conf directory, load the setting file: ssi_edw_config_imc.xml.
All the comments have been rewritten to eliminate the PHIs but keep similar description of the snippets.
